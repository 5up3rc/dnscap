dnscap (1.1.0-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 1.1.0

    The ownership of DNSCAP was transferred from ISC to DNS-OARC in
    the summer of 2016 and this is the first release since that.

    This project now uses Semantic Versioning and these are the changes
    since the `dnscap-20160205` release (which can also be found using
    the tag `v0.0.0-20160205`).

    Highlights:
    - Restructure repository and use autotools
    - Compiled and tested on Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, FreeBSD and OpenBSD
      using Jenkins and Travis-CI
    - Source code static analysis using Coverity Scan
    - Compatibility fixes for FreeBSD, OpenBSD and OS X
    - ABI change to `output()`, previous `isfrag` is now a `flags` that
      represents what the packet is through a bitmask
    - Use helper library `pcap-thread` when capturing to solve missing
      packets during very low traffic

    New command line options:
    - `-V`: Prints version and then exits
    - `-M`: Enable monitor mode on interfaces
    - `-D`: Enable immediate mode on interfaces
    - `-W`: Allow to specify a suffix for the pcap dump file
    - `-C`: Limit/rotate capture after a certain amount of bytes

    Special thanks to:
    - Duane Wessels
    - Paul Vixie
    - Klaus Darilion

    bc7eb22 Update license after ownership transfer from ISC to DNS-OARC,
            update contributors, add build badges and removed SuperFastHash
            since apparently it was not used.

    71c2d79 Fix #12: Sync man-page and help text
    33576ef Swap option C and D, C for this makes more sense. Also ensure
            that `capturedbytes` is zero on start.
    0077aff Correct dump trace with new `flags`
    f9cbba0 Do not use dump suffix unless it set

    341abdf Add -W feature: allow to specify a suffix for the pcap dump
            file, e. g.: '.pcap'
    097a3b4 Count every packet which is sent to output(), not only
            the normal ones.
    75e5968 Close PCAPs after dumper_close() to have statistics still
            available during dumper_close(). Otherwise we get a segfault
            on shutdown.

    7d6a7e4 Passing IPv6 fragment payloads may not currently be safe.
            Needs more work. For now pass pkt=NULL to be safe for plugins.
    ea8f9a4 Make the family of output() functions future proof with a flags
            bitmask. Rather than separate 'isfrag' and 'isdns' flags,
            they are now set as bitmasks in a single 'flags' value passed
            to output() f

    864cbd7 Can you change #ifdef __APPLE__ to check for the
            arpa/nameser_compat.h header and include it if it exists?
    796e8ea plugin/rssm needs to include arpa/nameser_compat.h for OS X

    0061b57 Work around configure problem detecting libresolv on Mac OS X
            Without some #include files, the configure test won't find
            the symbol res_mkquery() in libresolv on OS X.  It is called
            res_9_mkquery()
    5309655 Mac OS X doesn't have setresuid() and setresgid().
            This patch adds configure checks for setreuid() and setregid()
            and will use those instead if the other versions are
            not available.
