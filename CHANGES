	Added -Y option to specify the IP address of responses that
	should not be captured.  This option is useful when you want
	to capture queries and spoofed response (DDoS attack) traffic,
	but not the normal response traffic.

	Added -L option to specify that dnscap should capture both
	VLAN-tagged and un-tagged packets.  This is in contrast
	to the existing -l option which causes untagged packets
	to be ignored.

	Gave dnscap a ./configure script.  This should be more flexible
	with respect to whether or not libbind is installed.

	The bpf program omitted necessary terms to capture IPv6 frags
